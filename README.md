the Omnichord is a cool lil instrument but they're either ridiculously marked up or if you're lucky you can maybe find them at a thrift store or smth.
most of the examples I could find online don't take into account the ergodynamics or whatever of what an instrument SHOULD feel like imo (yk, with the comfort of your own laptop! a keyboard is a keyboard is a keyboard...) and instead overtweak on the emulation aspect.
try it by downloading the repo and opening index.html its kinda cool ig. eventually i'll make a gh pages 4it
